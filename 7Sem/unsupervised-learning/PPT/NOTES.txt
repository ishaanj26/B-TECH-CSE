RBM PPT NOTES FOR EACH SLIDES
RESTRICTED BOTZMAN MODEL

SLIDE1->
RBM stands for Restricted Boltzmann Machine, a type of probabilistic graphical model and generative stochastic neural network.

It is designed for unsupervised learning, meaning it can learn hidden patterns or structures from unlabeled data.

RBM models the joint probability distribution of visible input features and hidden latent features.

Example: Used to detect patterns in images or user behavior without requiring labeled data.
